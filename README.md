# cafe-app

This project is built with the [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and installation instructions for projects built with it can be substituted for these.

The short version of installation is this though.
* Clone the repo
* `npm install`
* `ng build --prod`
* Host the contents of the `/dist` directory with any HTTP server.
